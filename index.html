                <p>Avul Pakir Jainelabdeen Abdul Kalam was the 11th President of the country from 2002 and 2007 and is also popularly known as the 'Missile Man' of India.
                     Born in a poor family in Tamil Nadu's Rameswaram, Kalam went on to study physics and aerospace engineering and worked with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He also played a role in 1998 Pokhran-II tests under leadership of Atar Bihar Vajpayee. <p>Abdul Kalam was felicitated with a Padma Bhushan in 1981, Padma Vibhushan in 1990 and then received India's highest civilian honour Bharat Ratna in 1997. He is also known for a humble and respectful attitude towards people and was called the 'People's President'. After the end of his tenure as President of the country, he went back to delivering lectures to students and writing. He died after suffering cardiac arrest while delivering a lecture at Indian Institute of Management Shillong on July, 27, 2015. He was buried in his hometown Rameswaram with full state honours.</p>
                     <p>Kalam was extremely earnest and diligent in his studies, but his teachers recognised him as having a tremendous desire to study. He finished his secondary studies at Ramanathapuram’s Schwartz Secondary School. In 1955, he graduated from Saint Joseph’s College at Tiruchirappalli with a diploma in physics. He subsequently went to Madras to further his education, graduating from the Engineering And Technology Institute with a diploma in aircraft engineering. His dream of becoming a military pilot was crushed when the IAF only had eight slots available, and he finished ninth.</p>
                <p>Following graduation, he worked as a scientist for the “Defense Research Service” and the “Aeronautical Development Establishment."</p>

                <p>He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if that was tough or sensitive or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that he had to sign. The “office of profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. 
                    <p>This will allow the royal family to have zero influence on the administrative conditions.


                        He had also become one of the most talked-about presidents Rule in 2005 for imposing the Presidents’ rule in Bihar. Kalam expressed his wish to take up the position one more time but then later changed his mind.

He served as an Aerospace Engineering professor at Anna University, Tamil Nadu. He also lit up educational institutions like the Indian Institute of Indore, Indian Institute of Bangalore with his presence and knowledge.
